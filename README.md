## About

`pace` is a mindful productivity tool designed to help you keep track of your
activities with ease and intention.

Born from the desire to blend simplicity with effectiveness, pace offers a
command-line interface (CLI) that encourages focused work sessions, thoughtful
reflection on task durations, and a harmonious balance between work and rest.

Whether you're a developer, a writer, or anyone who values structured time
management, pace provides the framework to log activities, review progress, and
optimize how you spend your time.

With features like the first activity wizard for onboarding new users, real-time
configuration validation (upcoming), and personalized activity logs, pace is
more than a time tracker ‚Äî it's your partner in crafting a productive and
mindful routine.

## Minimum Rust version policy

This crate's minimum supported `rustc` version is `1.74.1`.

The current policy is that the minimum Rust version required to use this crate
can be increased in minor version updates. For example, if `crate 1.0` requires
Rust 1.20.0, then `crate 1.0.z` for all values of `z` will also require Rust
1.20.0 or newer. However, `crate 1.y` for `y > 0` may require a newer minimum
version of Rust.

In general, this crate will be conservative with respect to the minimum
supported version of Rust.
